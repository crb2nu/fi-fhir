### 2026-02-11: Use Incremental Contract-First Enhancement Strategy

- Decision:
  - Enhance ETL/parsing/transform/auditability incrementally on the current architecture, starting with API contract governance and drift checks.
- Rationale:
  - Existing parser tolerance, transform engine, event store, and replay capabilities are already mature enough to extend without a rewrite.
  - Current contract drift signals immediate risk that can be reduced quickly with compatibility gates.
- Alternatives considered:
  - Full ingestion platform rewrite (rejected for delivery and migration risk).
- Consequences:
  - Near-term investment in compatibility tooling, audit envelope design, and ETL persistence.
  - Lower migration risk and faster path to production hardening.
